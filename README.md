Project Description:
"Quotes" is a feature-rich mobile application developed using Flutter, incorporating concepts
such as SQLite Database, Animation, API Calling, and Local JSON Bank. The app provides
users with a diverse collection of inspirational quotes, empowering them with personalized
features and a visually appealing interface.
"Quotes" aims to provide an immersive and personalized experience for users seeking inspiration
and motivation. By incorporating SQLite Database, Animation, API Calling, Local JSON Bank,
fetching and saving quotes, category-wise organization, light and dark themes, splash screen,
detailed quote screens, random background images and font families, quote wallpaper creation,
and setting device wallpapers, the app offers a comprehensive solution for users to discover and
engage with uplifting quotes that resonate with them.

Project Objectives:

- SQLite Database: The app utilizes SQLite Database to efficiently store and manage the quotes.
Quotes fetched from the Local JSON Bank or API are inserted into a table, enabling seamless
access and retrieval of the quote data. The database allows for efficient categorization and
management of the quotes.
 - Animation: "Quotes" integrates animation techniques to create a dynamic and engaging user
interface. Animations are applied to various UI elements, adding visual flair and enhancing the
overall user experience.
 - API Calling: The app leverages API calls to fetch additional quotes, expanding the collection
beyond what is available in the Local JSON Bank. This ensures a diverse and ever-growing
collection of inspirational quotes for users to explore.
 - Local JSON Bank: In addition to API calling, the app utilizes a Local JSON Bank to provide a
base collection of quotes. This ensures that users have access to quotes even when offline or in
situations where API access is limited.
Fetch Quotes: "Quotes" fetches quotes from either the Local JSON Bank or the API and inserts
them into the SQLite Database. This allows users to explore a wide range of inspirational quotes
based on their preferences.
 - Save Category-Wise Quotes: The app enables users to save quotes based on different
categories, allowing for easy organization and retrieval of quotes that resonate with specific
themes or topics. Users can create and manage their own personalized collections of quotes.
Save Specific Quote Details: Users can save specific quote details as favorites, storing them in a
separate table within the SQLite Database. The app provides a dedicated page where users can
view and manage their favorite quotes, offering quick access to the quotes that inspire them the
most.
 - Light & Dark Themes: "Quotes" offers a visually appealing experience with customizable
themes. Users can switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences, ensuring
comfortable usage in different lighting conditions and personalizing their app experience.
Splash Screen: The app features an eye-catching splash screen that captivates users from the
moment they launch the app. The splash screen can showcase inspiring visuals or animations,
setting a positive and motivational tone for the user experience.
 - Detail Screen for Each Quote: Each quote has a dedicated detail screen that provides additional
information and options for customization. Users can explore the quote's content, set a random
background image, choose a random font family, copy and share the quote as a wallpaper, or
even set it as their device wallpaper.
